# Exercise (easy)
Create a dict with your friends ages

# Exercise (easy)
Transform this dict:
```python
{0: 10, 1: 20}
```
into this:
```python
{0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}
```

# Exercise (easy)
Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum value in a dictionary.

# Exercise (easy)
Print every key and value of this dictionary using for loop, and then using while loop:
```python
products = {
‘SMART WATCH’: 550,
‘PHONE’ : 1000,
‘PLAYSTATION’: 500,
‘LAPTOP’ : 1550,
‘MUSIC PLAYER’ : 600,
‘TABLET’ : 400
}
```

# Exercise (medium)
Write a Python program to remove duplicates values from Dictionary.

# Exercise (medium)
Write a Python script to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary. 

# Exercise (medium)
Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
```python
dic1={1:10, 2:20} 
dic2={3:30, 4:40} 
dic3={5:50,6:60}
```
```python
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
```

# Exercise (medium)
Use python to convert those two lists:
```python
list1 = ['Rick', 'Donald', 'Mickey' , 'Mario']
list2 = ['Sanchez', 'Duck', 'Mouse', 'Kart']
```
into this dictionnary:
```python
{
    'Rick': 'Sanchez'
    'Donald': 'Duck'
    'Mickey': 'Mouse'
    'Mario': 'Kart'
}

```

# Exercise (medium)
Ask the user how many money he got, then display products that he can afford.

```python
products = {
‘SMART WATCH’: 550,
‘PHONE’ : 1000,
‘PLAYSTATION’: 500,
‘LAPTOP’ : 1550,
‘MUSIC PLAYER’ : 600,
‘TABLET’ : 400

}
```

# Exercise (medium)
Get a number from the user, and then spell each number in words, for example, if the user input 1234:
```
one two three four
```

# Exercise (medium)
Get a number from the user and create a dictionnary where the keys are every number from 1 to this number, and values are the square of keys.
For example, if user input `5`:
```python
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

# Exercise (medium)
step 1
Make a dictionnary called contacts and add three of your friends with their phone number

Example:


    {"Eyal":"0586878399",
    "John":"0542815674",
    "Mario":"0512345678"}
step 2
Add another person

step 3
Write a loop that print every contact with his number

step 4
Write a code that searches if a given name exists in the contacts

step 5
Write a code that searches if a given number exists in the contacts, if it exist, then print his name.

step 6
Given another dictionnary of contacts, add it to your dictionnary

step 7
Count how many contacts are in your dictionnary

step 8
Print the contacts in alphabetic order with their number

# Exercise (hard)
Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys. Go to the editor
```python
d1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c':300}
d2 = {'a': 300, 'b': 200, 'd':400}
```
Output:
```python
{'a': 400, 'b': 400, 'd': 400, 'c': 300}
```
